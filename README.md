within that list that are anagrams of each other. If this process
finds that there are mpore than set of anagrams that meet this requirement
then the last found set is returned

There are two approaches to finding the largest set with corresponding methods

     1. LargestAnagramListFunctional() - functional extension method using LINQ
     2. LargestAnagramList()           - imperative method
